###### Check Yourself Final Mod 1

##### Overview:

  This project is a task list creator. The user can name a task list and then name & add task items to the task list. When the
task list is created a card will appear in the right hand column. When the card appears the entire form will be cleared and 
be ready for another task card to be added. The user can interact with the task cards by clicking the little circle next to a
task. This will update the task to completed. once all tasks are completed the task card delete button is activated and then can
be deleted from the DOM. The user can also click on the urgent button on a card marking it as urgent. The user can click
the filter by urgency button which will then only display urgent cards in the right column. The user can input anything in the 
search input and relateable cards will appear. If the filter by urgency button is clicked only urgent cards will be displayed.


##### Reflection:

The main focus of this project felt to be the Data Model. We have been updating the DOM for many things now. I felt as if this 
project was easier then build a bear simply beacuse I did build a bear. Ive learned to create layouts very quickly and now how 
to update the DOM well. The Data Model I understand pretty well now. I am interested to see where it goes when in mod 2. I am
sure it will get extremley more intensive.)
